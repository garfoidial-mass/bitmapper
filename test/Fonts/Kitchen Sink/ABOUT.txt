KITCHEN SINK

The textmode font "Kitchen sink" is provided in both PNG and BMP formats alongside a TTF file.

To use the special characters in the TTF version of the font, you can copy and paste the corresponding characters:

The font was designed to be viewed both in normal mode and inverted - we achieve this in programs like REXpaint, PLAYSCII and lvllvl.com by swapping the foreground and background colours. We have included an inverted version of the font as a TTF if you find this useful, as your specific implementation may vary.
